Hey there! I'm Allink, and I like to code. My most notable projects are DeviousMod, KBPW-Util, HClientPlus and Spermatozoa. I've contributed on [Kaboom's CommandSpy plugin], [Kaboom's Extras plugin], [Kaboom's iControlU plugin] and some minor changes to [Kaboom's Configuration] and [Kaboom's Weapons plugin].

I'm most fluent in Java and Javascript, but I also code in Golang and C# when I feel they're more useful.
